# Taking user input
# Input

# Let's take a look at the input command and how that works. Input is when the user gives information to the computer.

# It's very similar to the print command, except that it'll show the message in the console then wait until the user has typed something into the console and pressed enter. Let's try it!

 

# ðŸ‘‰ Copy this code into your coding editor in main.py and see what happens when you hit run:

# input("What's your name?: ")

Name = input("What's my name?")
Age = int(input("What's my age?"))
print("\n")
print("So your are: ")
print(Name)
print(f"{Name}is {Age} Years old")
print(Age)
